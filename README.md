University Database
This initiative aims to develop a comprehensive and integrated database system for a university environment. The proposed system will seamlessly connect departments, students, instructors, and other relevant stakeholders. By encompassing the management of academic data such as courses and enrollment, as well as co-curricular activities like clubs and alumni relations, this centralized platform will enhance administrative efficiency, ensure data accessibility, and empower informed decision-making across the university.
